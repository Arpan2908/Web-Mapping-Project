# Web-Mapping-Project
This repository is for an Individual project made for the completion of my MSGIS - Web Mapping and Open source course. This repository talks about how temporal data can be visualised using software such as Mapbox, Tableau and ArcGIS Pro. Data is for volcanic eruption through 2000 - 2020 around the world.
